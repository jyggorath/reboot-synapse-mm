# Reboot-Synapse (mm)
Reboots service for Razer Synapse and driver for Nvidia Quadro (which is often needed when connecting a laptop to Razer Core X Chroma).

## Installation
Place both `Reboot-Synapse.ps1` and `RebootSynapse.vbs` on the desktop (`C:\Users\USERNAME\Desktop\`).

If you wish to keep the scripts in a different path, you need to modify the path in `RebootSynapse.vbs`.

## Usage
Simply run `RebootSynapse.vbs`.

Alternativly, you can use the PowerShell console (as admin) to run `Reboot-Synapse.ps1` directly. If you prefer this, you don't need `RebootSynapse.vbs` at all.
